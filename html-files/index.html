            Parrot, term applied to a large group of gaudy,<br> 
            raucous birds of the family Psittacidae.<br>
             Parrot also is used in reference to<br> 
             any member of a larger bird group,<br>
              order Psittaciformes, which includes
             <br> cockatoos (family Cacatuidae) as well.<br>
              Parrots have been<br>
               kept as cage birds since ancient times, and<br> 
               they have always been popular because they are amusing,<br>
                intelligent, and often affectionate.
             <br>Several are astonishingly imitative of many sounds,<br>
              including human speech.
