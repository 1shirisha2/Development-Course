    <h1>Swami Vivekananda</h1>

    <p>Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta (name shortened to Narendra or Naren)<br> in a Bengali family in his ancestral home at 3 Gourmohan Mukherjee Street in Calcutta, the capital of British India, on 12 January 1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival.<br> He belonged to a traditional family and was one of nine siblings.</p>
    <h2>Travels in India (1888–1893)</h2>
    <p>n 1888, Narendra left the monastery as a Parivrâjaka— the Hindu religious life of a wandering monk, "without fixed abode, without ties,<br> independent and strangers wherever they go".<br> His sole possessions were a kamandalu (water pot), staff and his two favourite books: the Bhagavad Gita and The Imitation of Christ.<br>Narendra travelled extensively in India for five years, visiting centres of learning and acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and social patterns.<br> He developed sympathy for the suffering and poverty of the people, and resolved to uplift the nation.<br>Living primarily on bhiksha (alms), Narendra travelled on foot and by railway (with tickets bought by admirers). During his travels he met, and stayed with Indians from all religions and walks of life: scholars, dewans, rajas, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, paraiyars (low-caste workers) and government officials.<br>On 31 May 1893, Narendra left Bombay for Chicago with the name, as suggested by Ajit Singh of Khetri, <br>"Vivekananda"–a conglomerate of the Sanskrit words: viveka and ānanda, meaning "the bliss of discerning wisdom".[94][95]</p>
